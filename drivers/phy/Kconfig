config GENERIC_PHY
	tristate "PHY Core"
	help
	  Generic PHY support.

	  This framework is designed to provide a generic interface for PHY
	  devices present in the kernel. This layer will have the generic
	  API by which phy drivers can create PHY using the phy framework and
	  phy users can obtain reference to the PHY. All the users of this
	  framework should select this config.

	tristate "STMicroelectronics USB2 PHY driver for STiH41x series"
	depends on SOC_STIH415 || SOC_STIH416
	depends on GENERIC_PHY
	help
	  Enable this to support the USB transceiver that is part of
	  STMicroelectronics STiH41x SoC series.

config PHY_MIPHY365X
	tristate "STMicroelectronics MIPHY365X PHY driver for STiH41x series"
	depends on SOC_STIH415 || SOC_STIH416
	depends on GENERIC_PHY
	help
	  Enable this to support the miphy transceiver (for SATA/PCIE)
	  that is part of STMicroelectronics STiH41x SoC series.

config PHY_STID127_USB
	tristate "STMicroelectronics USB2 PHY driver for STiD127"
	depends on SOC_STID127
	depends on GENERIC_PHY
	help
	  Enable this to support the USB transceiver that is part of

	depends on SOC_STIH407 || SOC_STI8416
	depends on GENERIC_PHY
	help
	  Enable this to support the miphy transceiver (for SATA/PCIE/USB3)
	  that is part of STMicroelectronics STiH407 SoC.

config PHY_STIH407_USB
	tristate "STMicroelectronics USB2 picoPHY driver for STiH407 family"
	depends on SOC_STIH407
	depends on GENERIC_PHY
	help
	  Enable this support to enable the picoPHY device used by USB2
	  and USB3 controllers on STMicroelectronics STiH407 SoC families.

config PHY_STI8416_USB
	tristate "STMicroelectronics USB2 PHY driver for STi8416"
	depends on SOC_STI8416
	depends on GENERIC_PHY
