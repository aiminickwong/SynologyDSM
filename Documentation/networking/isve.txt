This is the Virtual Ethernet driver used in the new ST SoC generations.

It dials with a special HW bridge designed to allow the communication
among DOCSIS system and CPUs.

This means that all devices are connected through as sort of virtual
Ethernet devices and can communicate just like a simple Ethernet
network.

For each device it is allocated an instance of the driver that will use
some dedicated DMA queues for managing the transmission and reception
processes.
The reception process is also called Downstream Forwarding (DFWD) and provides
a output memory queue of 32 entries.
Transmission is the Upstream process, also called UPIIM, and provides input
queue of 32 elements.

For both RX and TX the check-sum is done in SW and all the socket buffers
passed from/to the DMA has to be aligned to a 32-byte boundary.

The TX and Rx processes are managed by using pre-allocated buffers in two
rings.
Streaming DMA mappings is used to map these buffer for the DMA from/to transfer,
Reception process is managed by NAPI.

ISVE also provides some internal statistic via ethtool and it's also
to change the driver's message level.

For platform parameters please see the devicetree binding documentattion.
