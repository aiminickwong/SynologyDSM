Binding for LPC Timer on STMicroelectronics STi series SoCs

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "st,st_lpc_timer"
- reg: Base address and length of the LPC Timers registers.
- clock-names: Set to "lpc_clk".
- clocks: phandle of the clock used by the LPC Timer

Example:
	lpc-timer@0x8788000 {
		compatible = "st,st_lpc_timer";
		reg = <0x8788000 0x1000>;
		clock-names = "lpc_clk";
		clocks = <&CLK_S_D3_FLEXGEN CLK_LPC_1>;
	};
