Binding for Thermal sensor driver for STMicroelectronics STi series of SoCs.

Required parameters:
1) compatible : st,<SoC>-<module>-thermal
		Should be one of
		"st,stih415-sas-thermal",
		"st,stih415-mpe-thermal",
		"st,stih416-sas-thermal"
		"st,stih416-mpe-thermal"
		"st,stid127-thermal" or
		"st,stih407-thermal" according to the
		SoC type (stih415, stih416, stid127, stih407) and module type (sas or mpe).
		On stid127 & stih407 there is only one die/module, so there is no module type in the
		compatible string.
2) clock-names : Should be set to "thermal".
3) clocks: 	phandle of the clock used by the thermal sensor.
		For (2) and (3) refer :
		Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

Optional:
1) reg :
	For non-sysconf based sensor's, physical base address and length of the
	sensor's registers.

2) interrupts:
	Standard way to define interrupt number.
	refer: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/resource-names.txt
	Interrupt is mandatory to be defined when compatible is stih416-mpe-thermal.
	For thermal sensor's for which no interrupt has been defined, a polling delay
	of 1000ms will be used to read the temperature from device.

3) st,passive_cooling_temp:
	The temperature at which passive cooling operations will be activated.
	Passive cooling uses cpu frequency scaling to cool the cpu.
	If passive cooling temp is set to zero or >= 125C, passive cooling
	will be disabled.
	If this property is not present, then the default passive cooling
	temperature will be 80C.

Example:
temp1{
	compatible	= "st,stih416-mpe-thermal";
	reg		= <0xfdfe8000 0x10>;
	clock-names	= "thermal";
	clocks		= <&CLK_M_MPETHSENS>;
	interrupts	=  <0 23 0>;
};
