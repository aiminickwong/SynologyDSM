* ST LPC RTC

Required properties:
- compatible : "st,lpc-rtc"
- interrupt-parent: controller from which depends the IRQ
- reg : Address range of the rtc registers
- interrupts: Should contain the rtc interrupt number
- clock-names : Should be "lpc_rtc"
- clocks: Clock used by RTC device

Example:

	rtc@0xfde05000 {
	        compatible = "st,lpc-rtc";
		interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
	        reg = <0xfde05000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 118 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
		clock-names = "lpc_rtc";
		clocks		= <&CLK_M_MPETHSENS>;
	};
