ST HCD (Host Controller Driver) for USB 2.0 and 1.1

The device node has following properties.

Required properties:
 - compatible: must be "st,usb-3000-065lp"
 - st,amba-config: stbus to amba bridge settings to configure usb2 plug.
 - reg: physical base addresses of the controller and length of memory mapped
   region.
 - reg-names: Names associated to the reg defines above.
   Should be "ehci", "ohci" and "protocol".
 - interrupts: interrupt numbers to the cpu.
 - interrupt-names: should be "ehci" and "ohci".
 - pinctrl-names, pinctrl-0: the pincontrol settings to configure muxing
   properly for USB pins.
 - clocks: from common clock binding: handle to usb clocks.
 - clock-names: from common clock binding:
   Must be "ic" for the interconnect clock and "ohci" for the 48MHz clock.
 - resets, reset-names: the power-down and soft-reset lines of USB IP.
   Associated names must be "powerdown" and "softreset".

Example:

st_usb_bus_config: st-usb-amba-config {
			st,bridge_type2;
			st,sd_config_missing;
			st,complete_on_error;
			st,read_ahead;
			st,max_opcode_LD64_ST64;
			st,chunks_in_msg = <0>;
			st,packets_in_chunk = <2>;
			st,threshold = <256>;
		};
