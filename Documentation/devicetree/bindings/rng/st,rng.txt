Random number generator driver for STMicroelectronics STiH41x series of SoCs.

Required parameters:
1) compatible	: should be "st,rng"
2) reg		: Base address of the HW IP and Size of its memory map.
3) clock	: Input Clock

Example:
rng0{
	compatible      = "st,rng";
	reg		= <0xfee80000 0x1000>;
	clocks          = <&CLK_SYSIN>;
}
