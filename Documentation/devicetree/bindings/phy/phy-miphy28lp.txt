STMicroelectronics STi MIPHY28LP PHY binding
============================================

This binding describes a miphy device that is used to control PHY hardware
for SATA, PCIe or USB3.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "st,miphy28lp-phy"
- #phy-cells: 1, see below
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
- reg-names: The names of the register addresses corresponding to the registers
   filled in "reg". Is can also contain the offset of the system configuration
   registers used as glue-logic to setup the device for SATA/PCIe or USB3
   devices.
- st,syscfg : should be a phandle of the syscfg node.
- resets, reset-names: soft-reset lines of MIPHY IP.
   Associated names must be "miphy-sw-rst".

Optional properties:
- st,osc-rdy: to check the MIPHY0_OSC_RDY status in the glue-logic. This
  is not available in all the MiPHY. For example, for STiH407, only the MiPHY0
  has this bit.
- st,osc-force-ext: to select the external oscillator. This can change from
  different MiPHY inside the same SoC.
- st,sata_gen: to select which SATA_SPDMODE has to be set in the SATA system
  config register.
- st,px_rx_pol_inv: to invert polarity of RXn/RXp (respectively negative line and positive
  line).
- st,scc-on: enable ssc on sata/pcie to reduce effects of EMI.

example:

		miphy28lp_phy0: miphy28lp@0 {
			compatible	= "st,miphy28lp-phy";
			#phy-cells	= <1>;
			reg		= <0x9b22000 0xff>,
					  <0x9b09000 0xff>,
					  <0x9b04000 0xff>,
					  <0x114 0x4>,
					  <0x818 0x4>,
					  <0xe0  0x4>,
					  <0xec  0x4>;
			reg-names	= "sata-up", "pcie-up", "pipew",
					  "miphy-ctrl-glue",
					  "miphy-status-glue",
					  "pcie-glue", "sata-glue";
			st,syscfg	= <&syscfg_core>;

			resets		= <&softreset STIH407_MIPHY0_SOFTRESET>;
			reset-names	= "miphy-sw-rst";
		};


Specifying phy control of devices
=================================

Device nodes should specify the configuration required in their "phys"
property, containing a phandle to the miphy device node and an index
specifying which configuration to use, as described in phy-bindings.txt.

example:
		sata0: sata@9b20000  {
			...
			phys		= <&miphy28lp_phy0 MIPHY28LP_SATA>;
			phy-names	= "ahci_phy";
			...
		};
