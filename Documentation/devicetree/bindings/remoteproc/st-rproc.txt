STMicroelectronics remote processor support
===========================================================================

This binding provides support for adjunct processors found on ST SoCs.
The remote processors can be started/stopped by the Linux driver, or they can
be started by a boot loader (and thus are already be running when Linux
starts). The driver detects if a remote processor is already running.

The node name is significant, as it defines the name of the CPU and the name
of the firmware to load: rproc-<name>-fw.

Required properties:
- compatible: Must contain "st,rproc".
- boot_addr: The register that holds the boot vector for the CPU.
	The format for this is <regmap_phandle reg lsb msb>, with
	regmap_phandle: reference to a "syscon" node.
	reg: register offset in the regmap.
	lsb: least significant bit to use.
	msb: most significant bit to use.
- resets, reset-names: the soft-reset lines for the CPU.
	Associated names must be "manual_reset" and "power_reset".

Optional properties:
- interrupts: interrupt-specifier for the watchdog interrupt generated by the
	CPU. Refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/resource-names.txt

Example node:

cpu1@0 {
	compatible	= "st,rproc";
	boot_addr	= <&syscfg_cpu 0x98 0 28>;
	resets		= <&softreset 0>, <&softreset 1>;
	reset-names	= "manual_reset", "power_reset";
	interrupts	=  <0 38 0>;
};
