This is a sample program to demonstrate the very basics of using the
Multi Traget Trace API. The actual documentation for MTT is located
int Documentation: mtt.txt

build the module with the regular makefile:

make -C <configured kdir> M=`pwd` modules modules_install

build the app simply by calling `make`

On the target, insert the test module with

#>modprobe mttsample_mod

Setup the trace system:

#>mttcontrol --setup -m stm
#>mttcontrol --start

run the sample client application:

#>mttsample

you may view the traces using the Application Trace Logger.
